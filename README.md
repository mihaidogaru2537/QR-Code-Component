## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- border-radius will not round the edges nicely unless you use it on a square.
- Applying the same left padding on siblings h2 and p elements will not show the same output as applying the left padding only on their container.
- Now that I think again, another solution would have been to apply the same inline margin to the siblings.
- Another nice trick that I figured out is to add explicit width and padding to the card. This way you can use width: 100% on the picture.
  I feel like I have better control of the total width in this way.

### Continued development

I'd like to focus more on responsiveness in the future. I think it is not enough what was done for now.

### Useful resources

- [TypeScale](https://typescale.com/) - Helped me establish a font-size scale. I used the Perfect Fifth and a base size of ten.
